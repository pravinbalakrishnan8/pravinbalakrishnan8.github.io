This chapter explores the complexities surrounding the Malaysian education system in terms of race relations, political need of reform, and geographical diversity. In terms of race relations, the establishment of vernacular schools which was initially intended to cater to the sensitivities of the multi-ethnic character of the Malaysian population has continued the racial division of students in primary schooling along the lines of ethno-linguistic heterogeneity. This chapter also looks at the Malaysian Education Blueprint, an ambitious plan to reform the education system, which stemmed out of political necessity from the previous government in addressing the publicâ€™s disapproval of the education system. Finally, the inherent geographical diversity in Malaysia has further magnified the differences of educational attainment of the different layers of the Malaysian community.
