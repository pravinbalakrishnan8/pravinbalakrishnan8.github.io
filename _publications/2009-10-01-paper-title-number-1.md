The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in education systems around the planet to shift to an
emergency-response mode. This paper explores educational responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in
the national education systems of Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. In order to examine
the educational responses, this study employed a document analysis technique in building a simple case
study for each country. To furnish the document analysis, social media platforms of each countryâ€™s
ministry or departments of education were searched for items related to COVID-19 education
management. To provide a granular understanding of local educational responses, one English-based
online newspaper was selected from each country and educational news related to COVID-19 were
coded and analysed from the period of global lockdown in March 2020 to July 2020. It was evident that
whilst all of these countries pivoted to online learning during the initial stage of the lockdown, all of
them pushed to open schools as early as possible as online learning was found to be ineffective and
further exacerbated existing inequalities in education. This study established several takeaways, which
included that private-public partnerships and community-based initiatives are essential in mitigating
the education crisis caused by COVID-19.
